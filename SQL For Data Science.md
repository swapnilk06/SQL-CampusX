# What is SQL :

## Structure Query Language
 - in short its programing language.
 - SQL is designed for **managing data in a relational database management system** (RDBMS).
 - SQL is a database language, it is used for **database creation, deletion, fetching rows, and modifying rows, etc.**

> NOTE: Database are 2 types mostly :- 1st => SQL base & 2nd =>  No SQL base or RDBMS.<br>

### RDBMS -
 - RDBMS is style of database storage(In there make table & relationship between them through tables) --> then all tables are logically connected with each other that system called as **RDBMS.**
 - Language which is use to handing RDBMS called as (language) => **SQL.**
 - All over world all types of RDBMS are currently present they handle through **SQL.**
 - **SQL is most important for Software industry.**

### SQL - 
 - SQL is basically a **set of commands.** - SQL is programming language but its different type.

### Why SQL so important ?
 - **Current industry 80% of company's** (without them of mongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch) are **SQL base RDBMS database.**
- That's why SQL is extermely important for software industry.
- Cloud Technologies & Big Data Technologies are softwares using **SQL integration.**

### Why is SQL important in Data Science?
- The not so evolved Data ecosystem.
   - Without top level company's data infrastructure is **not good.**
   - e.g. You can join as data scientist (in low level company's) mostly Data Engineering team are not available. --> Your responsiblity is data gathering from database - analysis model building & give result.
   - But, in well organise company have Data Engineering team working of Extracting data before your work & give's to data science team for work.
   - All over sector is very unorganized that are huge chance on you can go in comapny from running database extract data & work it on model building & result **is your responsibility.**
   - These basis data scientist has **direct intraction with SQL base databases.** because ***data sources is database.***<br>
- **Initial understanding of the data** SQL is so powerful.
   - e.g. Values missing, maximum value of column or small level run analysis **we don't need to run data seperate on python, pandas** - **its directly run on database using SQL.**
   - **Initial set of task in machine learning work flow is also do by only using SQL (***we don't  need to required of python***).**
